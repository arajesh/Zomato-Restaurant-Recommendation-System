**zomato-recommendation-system**
A content-based recommender system that recommends restaurants similar to a restaurant the user provides and additional analysis 

**Background**
Eating out is fun and exciting but the excitement dies in the process of picking a restaurant. The process of picking usually starts with the husband/wife naming a favourite restaurant (The Initial Suggestion) and the other person not liking the idea/cuisine or maybe having a different place in mind. This slowly trickles down to opening Yelp/Zomato to look for suggestions and a lot of scrolling menus, restaurants, ratings, prices, photos, maps and I’m already hangry!!!

**Solution**
With the help of some data and some science I propose a recommendation system for restaurants in Hyderabad/Bay Area (any one) which lists out a bunch of options based on “The Initial Suggestion”

**Additional questions answered:**

1. What cuisine is the most popular?
2. Which restaurant has the best overall rating?
3. What are the most reviewed restaurants?
4. Which are some upscale places to dine at?

**Analysis Method**
Gather Zomato Restaurant Dataset and explore the data to look for some popular options, look at area specific average ratings, get an understanding at the most popular food location in the area. Build some plots to better look at trends, top listings etc. Build a basic recommendation system based on data science techniques by taking into consideration restaurant names, rating, cost etc. 

**Metrics**
% of Vegetarian Restaurants
Avg Price of Restaurants per Cuisine
Average ratings per area
Correlations between Rating and Price
Top 5 areas with highest late night restaurants


**Estimated Time**
2 Weeks

**Expected Outcomes**
Jupyter Notebook with dataset, code, visualisation and a working recommendation system and have it all in personal Github.
